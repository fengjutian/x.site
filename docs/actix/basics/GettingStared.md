# 开始
## 安装 Rust

<!-- If you don't have Rust yet, we recommend you use `rustup` to manage your Rust installation. [The official rust guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html) has a wonderful section on getting started. -->

如果您还没有 Rust，我们建议您使用 Rustup 来管理 Rust 安装。[官方 Rust 指南](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html)是一个很棒的入门教程。

Actix Web currently has a minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) of 1.59. Running `rustup update` will ensure you have the latest and greatest Rust version available. As such, this guide assumes you are running Rust 1.59 or later.

# Hello, world!

Start by creating a new binary-based Cargo project and changing into the new directory:

```xml
cargo new hello-world
cd hello-world
```
Add `actix-web` as a dependency of your project by adding the following to your Cargo.toml file.
```xml
[dependencies]
actix-web = "4"
```
Request handlers use async functions that accept zero or more parameters. These parameters can be extracted from a request (see `FromRequest` trait) and returns a type that can be converted into an `HttpResponse` (see `Responder` trait):

Replace the contents of `src/main.rs` with the following:

```rust
use actix_web::{get, post, web, App, HttpResponse, HttpServer, Responder};

#[get("/")]
async fn hello() -> impl Responder {
    HttpResponse::Ok().body("Hello world!")
}

#[post("/echo")]
async fn echo(req_body: String) -> impl Responder {
    HttpResponse::Ok().body(req_body)
}

async fn manual_hello() -> impl Responder {
    HttpResponse::Ok().body("Hey there!")
}
```

Notice that some of these handlers have routing information attached directly using the built-in macros. These allow you to specify the method and path that the handler should respond to. You will see below how to register manual_hello (i.e. routes that do not use a routing macro).

Next, create an App instance and register the request handlers. Use App::service for the handlers using routing macros and App::route for manually routed handlers, declaring the path and method. Finally, the app is started inside an HttpServer which will serve incoming requests using your App as an "application factory".

Further append the following main function to src/main.rs:

```rust
#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    HttpServer::new(|| {
        App::new()
            .service(hello)
            .service(echo)
            .route("/hey", web::get().to(manual_hello))
    })
    .bind(("127.0.0.1", 8080))?
    .run()
    .await
}
```
That's it! Compile and run the program with cargo run. The #[actix_web::main] macro executes the async main function within the actix runtime. Now you can go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/ or any of the other routes you defined to see the results.
